## Class Diagram


The **Class Diagram** for Blinkit represents the core components and their relationships within the system. It outlines the main classes such as **User**, **Product**, **Order**, **Payment**, and **Delivery**, showing their attributes and methods.

- **User**: Manages user details like name, email, and orders.
- **Product**: Represents products with attributes like name, price, and stock.
- **Order**: Contains details about the user's orders, including the product list and order status.
- **Payment**: Handles payment details for orders, including methods and payment status.
- **Delivery**: Manages delivery details like delivery status and address.

**Relationships**:
- A **User** can place multiple **Orders**.
- An **Order** can contain multiple **Products**.
- Each **Order** is associated with one **Payment** and one **Delivery**.

This diagram provides a structural view of Blinkit's system, illustrating how the different components interact with each other.

## Sequence Diagram 


### **Explanation:**

A **Sequence Diagram** is a type of interaction diagram that shows how objects or components interact with each other over time. It emphasizes the sequence of messages exchanged between components for a specific process.

For Blinkit, a Sequence Diagram could show the following process for placing an order:
1. **User** logs in and browses the product catalog.
2. **Backend** fetches the product details and displays them to the user.
3. **User** adds products to the cart and proceeds to checkout.
4. **Payment Gateway** processes the payment and confirms the payment success.
5. **Backend** confirms the order and sends the request to the **Delivery System**.
6. **Delivery System** processes the shipment of the product to the customer.

### **Key Points:**
- Sequence Diagrams provide a detailed breakdown of the interactions that happen step-by-step.
- They are useful for understanding the exact flow of operations in processes like order placement, payment processing, and delivery.

## UseCase Diagram
### **Explanation:**

A **Use Case Diagram** is a high-level visual representation of the system, showing the interactions between users (actors) and the systemâ€™s functionalities (use cases). It is designed to capture the functional requirements of the system.

For Blinkit, a Use Case Diagram would involve the following key actors:
- **User**: The customer interacting with the Blinkit system (e.g., registering, browsing, ordering).
- **Payment Gateway**: The external system used to process payments.
- **Delivery System**: The external system responsible for delivering products after successful payment.

### **Use Cases for Blinkit**:
- **User**: Can register, log in, browse products, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout.
- **Payment Gateway**: Handles payment processing and confirmation.
- **Delivery System**: Responsible for confirming and shipping products once payment is confirmed.

### **Key Points:**
- Use Case Diagrams highlight high-level functionalities of the system.
- They help in identifying how external systems (like payment and delivery) integrate with the Blinkit platform.

## Swimlane Diagram
### **Explanation:**

A **Swimlane Diagram** is a visual representation that divides different processes into "lanes" based on the roles or actors responsible for them. This type of diagram is useful for understanding how different components of the Blinkit system interact during specific workflows.

For Blinkit, the Swimlane Diagram would typically include lanes such as:
- **Customer Lane**: Contains actions performed by the user, like logging in, browsing products, and placing orders.
- **Backend Lane**: Represents actions handled by the Blinkit backend, like authenticating users, fetching product data, and confirming orders.
- **Payment Gateway Lane**: Shows the interaction with the payment system during checkout and payment processing.
- **Delivery System Lane**: Represents actions taken by the delivery system, such as confirming and shipping the product.

### **Key Points:**
- Swimlane diagrams help clarify which system component is responsible for each part of the process.
- The diagram could represent user actions, backend processes, payment handling, and delivery steps.
