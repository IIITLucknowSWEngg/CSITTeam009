# Testing Blinkit Application Project

Testing is a critical phase in the development of the Blinkit Application to ensure it meets its intended requirements, functions correctly, and provides a smooth user experience. Below are key steps and considerations for the testing phase of the Blinkit Application.

---

## 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual features like **product search**, **order placement**, **real-time tracking**, and **payment processing**.
- Validate APIs for **user authentication**, **inventory updates**, and **order management**.  
  **Example:** Ensure the cart updates correctly when items are added or removed.

---

## 2. Integration Testing
- Validate interactions between modules, including **backend servers**, **database systems**, and **mobile client interfaces**.
- Test the integration of third-party services like **payment gateways** and **SMS/Email notifications**.  
  **Example:** Ensure that order confirmation notifications trigger correctly upon successful payment.

---

## 3. Functional Testing
- Verify essential functionalities, such as:
  - **Product Browsing**
  - **Adding Items to Cart**
  - **Order Placement and Tracking**
  - **Delivery Scheduling**  
  **Example:** Confirm that users can search for items, add them to the cart, and complete the checkout process seamlessly.

---

## 4. User Interface (UI) Testing
- Ensure an **intuitive and user-friendly UI** with clearly visible buttons (e.g., Search, Add to Cart, Checkout).
- Test for **dark mode compatibility** and responsiveness across devices.  
  **Example:** Verify that the "Track Order" button is easily accessible and provides real-time updates.

---

## 5. Performance Testing
- Simulate high user traffic to assess system performance under peak loads.
- Measure app response times during actions like **searching products** and **processing orders**.  
  **Example:** Test how quickly the app displays search results when queried by thousands of users simultaneously.

---

## 6. Security Testing
- Test for vulnerabilities like **unauthorized access** to user accounts or **manipulation of order details**.
- Validate secure payment processing and data encryption.  
  **Example:** Simulate a man-in-the-middle attack and ensure sensitive user data remains protected.

---

## 7. Usability Testing
- Gather feedback from users with different technical expertise.
- Focus on features like **product recommendations**, **filtering options**, and **navigation**.  
  **Example:** Verify that users can easily locate and apply discount coupons during checkout.

---

## 8. Compatibility Testing
- Test the application across:
  - **Browsers:** Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox.
  - **Devices:** Smartphones, tablets.
  - **Operating Systems:** Android, iOS.  
  **Example:** Ensure smooth functioning of the app on low-end Android devices.

---

## 9. Regression Testing
- Revalidate existing test cases after implementing updates or new features, such as **multi-language support** or **loyalty programs**.  
  **Example:** Confirm that the order tracking functionality remains unaffected after adding delivery partner details.

---

## 10. Deployment Testing
- Test the application in **production-like environments** to ensure it works as expected in real-world conditions.
- Conduct live tests with a limited group of users to validate deployment readiness.  
  **Example:** Roll out the app to a small region to assess server stability and gather user feedback.

## Feature: User Registration

### Scenario: User registers successfully

#### Description:
Ensure users can register successfully and are redirected to the login page after completion.

### Steps:

describe('Blinkit User Registration', function() {
  it('should register the user successfully', function() {
    registrationPage.open();
    registrationPage.fillRegistrationForm('Saloni Sharma', 'saloni@example.com', 'securePassword123');
    registrationPage.submitForm();
    expect(registrationPage.getSuccessMessage()).to.equal('Registration successful');
    expect(browser.getUrl()).to.include('/login');
  });
});

# Blinkit - User Login Test
